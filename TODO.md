- ctrl+backspace to delete word (hard to implement, sent sequences are not consistent across terminals, backspace and ctrl+backspace are swapped in some terminals)
- allow custom SIGINT handler
- Tab completion
- switch to keypress events instead of data events for better control
- use util.format for logging
- fix line wrapping
